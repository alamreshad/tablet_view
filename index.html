                "Ador is 1 year old. He is a very vocal cat who loves to be petted on his head. 
                Ador enjoys wrestling with his sister Maya, who is a few months older than him. 
                During Ador’s free time, he enjoys looking out the window to see birds and occasionally squirrels in our neighborhood who stop by to say hi to him!"

                "Ador is also very shy and timid. 
                He doesn’t like to be in social situations and tends to hide behind a couch or run down to the basement. 
                Though, once you get to know Ador, he is very affectionate and will often lick your hand when you pet him. 
                Ador’s favorite snack flavors are chicken and turkey, and if you give him enough treats he will thank you for it vocally with his meows!"

                years old and still acts like a younger cat, despite being middle-aged."

                Despite being awake for long periods of time, they naturally hide in their habitats, and can be difficult to see in their inclosures.  
                Guinea pigs naturally are social creatures that enjoy socializing with other guinea pigs, in the wild they form packs of five to ten."

                he can tell whenever someone is about to give good to him by waiting at the end of the cardboard box patio he has attached to his cage."

                She makes it clear when she has a demand of any sort by complaining in a loud, distinguished manner. 
                If what she says could be translated, it probably would be, “This is atrocious, the water container has been empty for the 3rd time this week.

                "Despite her cuteness and royalty, she actually suffers from a genetic disorder intentionally brought upon by humans. 
                I highly advise against keeping a Scottish fold because they are in constant pain when they reach around 2 years old. 
                Cartilage accumulates around her paw joints and tail joints and it becomes painful for them to even walk. 
                She is living evidence of human’s cruelty of breeding animals to look pretty while sacrificing the animals’ health."
